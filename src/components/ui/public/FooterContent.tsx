          Why you should choose Goaround car rental
        </h5>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-400">
          Goaround car sharing is an environmentally friendly, convenient, and
          affordable alternative to traditional car rental. When you rent a car
          with Goaround, you’re actively choosing to share an individual owner’s
          car when they wouldn’t be driving it anyway. That helps keep new cars
          off the road, giving the environment a tiny break it desperately
          needs. Goaround cars are conveniently located across communities, at
          airports, and in cities around the world. That means car-sharing
          guests benefit from having affordable and convenient access to nearby
          rental cars. But there’s more! Goaround car rental is super flexible.
          You can rent a car by the hour or by the day. And, if your plans
          change, no big deal! You can cancel within 1 hour of booking or more
          than 24 hours before the start of your trip for free.
